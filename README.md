# textifai

Forked from [SaaS-starter](https://github.com/danielsteman/saas-starter).

## Structure

Following microservices architecture, the backend is separated into several smaller components (as suggested by [nodebestpractices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/blob/master/sections/projectstructre/breakintcomponents.md)), each being a separate Express app.

## Development

### Install:

- Node v18
  - You can use `nvm` to easily switch between Node versions. Read [install instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
- Yarn
  - Is faster than NPM and be installed with [these instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
- [gcloud cli](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

### Authenticate

Use [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#local-dev)

```
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login
```

When you're done:

```
gcloud auth application-default revoke
```

### ðŸŒŽ Environment variables used by the Firebase client library:

- VITE_FIREBASE_APIKEY
- VITE_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN
- VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECTID
- VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET
- VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID
- VITE_FIREBASE_APPID

These can be found in `project settings > general > your apps` in the code snippet at the bottom of the page. Copy + paste them in `/packages/web/.env.local` as `${KEY}=${VALUE}`.

### Global node dependencies:

`npm install -g typescript` to globally install Typescript.

`npm i -g gitmoji-cli` to install and `gitmoji init` in the cloned repository to be prompted for commit message emojis at every commit (works like a pre-commit-hook). Categorizes commits in a silly way.

### Start

A development server can be started for each packages with a universal command: `yarn dev`, ran from the root of each packages, for example:

```
>>> pwd
/textifai/packages/web
>>> yarn dev
yarn run ...
```

## Database

Documents (just PDF for now, later support for more file types) uploaded by users are stored in Firebase cloud storage. Document metadata, project data, additional user data, and such, are stored in a Firestore in several collections. The read/write rules of collections are tracked in `firebase.rules`.

## Deployment

Deployments are done with Terraform Cloud, which receives GCP credentials through `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, which should be set to the json key of a (manually created) service account without newlines. The json key can be retrieved through the GCP console and can be transformed to a single line using `cat ~/Downloads/keyfile.json| tr -s '\n' ' '`.

When the project is deployed for the first time, some manual steps are required to bootstrap the project. After deploying `google_firebase_web_app`, go to the console and go through the "OAuth consent screen page" steps. Then, go to the credentials page and add a web application. Make sure that `https://{PROJECT_ID}.firebaseapp.com` is in "Authorized JavaScript origins" and `https://{PROJECT_ID}.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler` in "Authorized redirect URIs".

Pass the `oauth_client_secret` variable in Terraform Cloud.

## CI

On opening a pull request:

- Build and test packages
- Build docker images
- Run speculative Terraform plan

On pushing to main:

- Run apply Terraform plan

## Payments

Use Stripe and explore [stripe Terraform providers](https://github.com/franckverrot/terraform-provider-stripe) to track pricing changes with git.
