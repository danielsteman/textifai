Forked from [SaaS-starter](https://github.com/danielsteman/saas-starter).

### Structure

Following microservices architecture, the backend is separated into several smaller components (as suggested by [nodebestpractices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/blob/master/sections/projectstructre/breakintcomponents.md)), each being a separate Express app.

### Development

Install:

- Node v16
- Yarn

Global node dependencies:

`npm install -g typescript` to globally install Typescript.

`npm i -g gitmoji-cli` to install and `gitmoji install` in the cloned repository to be prompted for awesome commit message emojis at every commit (works like a pre-commit-hook).
