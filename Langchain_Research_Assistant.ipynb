              "   'abstract': \"Since 2000, the speedy development of information technology (IT), Internet, information systems (IS), social networks service (SNS), and artificial intelligence (AI), is indeed a significant issue to support the enterprises to offer their products and services to their global customers. Meanwhile, adopting these technologies to help employees work also pushes IT development progress from the SARS crisis in 2003, to the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak period At the same time, the information systems (IS) is a core capability of an organization in controlling the critical downstream and upstream data. Therefore, how to develop a robust IS to support the globalization of enterprises has been the critical issue from the 2008 financial crisis to the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak period. Since it is the IT personnel to maintain this core capability for the organization, and how an organization can retain the valuable ITP is likely to become a critical factor in the attainment of their strategic goals. Because the job of ITP cannot be separated from IT, and they are the main staff of IS/IT. The ITP have higher stress as they are expected to keep the technology working and the computer applications functioning around the clock in organizations to help their colleagues, and can be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week (24/7). The supervisor's work-related instant messages (IM) after working hours of the employees will increase their dissatisfaction with their company. Scholars found that high permeability of work-family borders increased work-family conflict in the context of telecommuting and ICT usage at home. These situations will make the ITP experience more technostress, have lower productivity and job satisfaction, and increase the work exhaustion and job burnout of the ITP. Exhaustion can occur in various work environments, the popular press and the research literature suggest that the ITP is of an increasing concern. Stressed ITP tend to be fatigued, are prone to mistakes and injuries, and more likely to be absent, resulting in healthcare costs that are twice as high as those of other employees. For these reasons, work exhaustion of the ITP is particularly worthy to investigate because it may well be contributing to the increased turnover among them. Because national cultures will vary people's expectations for regulating and expressing their emotions in the workplace. Especially in the increasing globalization and concomitant increasing competition era, there is enormous pressure exerted on such organizations to restructure so as to enable them to compete successfully in a borderless world through IT. In addition, scholars have demonstrated the national cultural impact on work exhaustion. Because the huge amount of e-commerce and the convenient IT in Chinese society are growing consistently and rapidly, then many employees rely on IS/IT to complete their tasks assigned by the company. Chinese ITP will sacrifice individual well-beings for group harmony, in turn, their higher job burnout level will be induced. However, rarely have scholars studied this issue that has focused on Chinese cultural society. For this reason, this study will investigate the Chinese cultural society that may have a more imminent impact on job burnout and work exhaustion, and guanxi is one of the major dynamics where business/individual exchange revolves around Chinese society. In light of this, this study try to resolve the research question is: how the IT characteristics, and guanxi will interact with each other, and influence the work exhaustion, in turn, to influence job burnout outcomes of the Chinese ITP. Therefore, this study believes that it is necessary to use a quantitative research method to better understand the antecedents of work exhaustion of Chinese ITP, and to explore the relationship between guanxi and work exhaustion of ITP will be a significant issue. Thus, this study based on Job Burnout Model and Chinese Guanxi Perspective, adopts qualitative research method to collect Chinese ITP's data. This study conducted a multiple-case study as the research strategy, and follows a positivist process while allowing sufficient evidence to suggest additional relationships. The process and expectations of validity and rigor for this study are derived from the current practice. Finally, has the contribution from both academics and practice resolved the job burnout research.\",\n",
